# TalentStreamAI

Squad Five capstone for the Andela AI Engineering Bootcamp. The goal is straightforward on paper: help a candidate move from “I found a role” to “I submitted strong materials” without burning an afternoon on manual rewrites. This repository is the **scaffold** only—FastAPI for the API surface, a static-export Next.js client, and a **Terraform root** that is intentionally empty except for provider wiring, variables, outputs, and comments that describe the AWS shape you are heading toward (Aurora Serverless v2 + Data API, Secrets Manager, ECS or Lambda for LangGraph/OpenRouter, API Gateway + Clerk JWT, CloudFront in front of S3). Implementers add resources when they are ready.

Product direction (for context while you build):

- Ingest a resume plus a job posting URL.
 - Diff the candidate's story against the role (ATS-oriented gap analysis).
 - Generate refreshed resume copy, a cover letter with narrative structure, and a Gmail-ready draft.

## Implementation Status

The backend is now fully implemented with a LangGraph-based workflow for generating job application materials.

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/v1/apply` | POST | Run the complete TalentStreamAI workflow |
| `/api/v1/fetch-job` | POST | Fetch and parse a job description from URL |
| `/api/v1/parse-resume` | POST | Parse a resume file (PDF or DOCX) |
| `/api/v1/score-ats` | POST | Score resume against job description for ATS compatibility |

#### Apply Endpoint (Main)

The main `/api/v1/apply` endpoint accepts:
- `job_url` (str): URL of the job posting
- `resume` (UploadFile): Resume file (PDF or DOCX)

Returns job data, resume data, ATS score, gap analysis, tailored resume, cover letter, and email draft.

### LangGraph Workflow

The workflow consists of these nodes executed in sequence:

1. **fetch_job**: Fetches job description from URL using web scraping
2. **parse_resume**: Parses PDF/DOCX resume into structured data
3. **score_ats**: Scores resume against job requirements
4. **analyze_gaps**: Identifies keyword and skill gaps
5. **generate_resume**: Generates ATS-optimized tailored resume (LLM)
6. **generate_cover_letter**: Generates narrative cover letter (LLM)
7. **generate_email**: Generates Gmail-ready email draft (LLM)

### Tools

Located in `backend/app/tools/`:
- **job_fetcher.py**: Fetches and parses job descriptions from URLs
- **resume_parser.py**: Parses PDF and DOCX resumes
- **ats_scorer.py**: Scores resumes against job requirements for ATS compatibility
- **models.py**: Pydantic models for all tool inputs and outputs

### Environment Variables

Required in `.env`:
| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` | At least one for `AGENT_MODE=llm`: OpenRouter for chat if set, else `OPENAI_API_KEY` (see `.env.example`). |
| `LANGFUSE_*` | Optional: Langfuse keys for API-side LLM observability (see `.env.example`). |

## Prerequisites

Pick what matches how you work day to day:

- **Docker Desktop** (or Docker Engine) plus the Compose plugin for the one-command local stack.
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)** for installing and running the Python service (lockfile-backed).
- **Python 3.12** (`backend/.python-version` helps pyenv/asdf) and **Node.js 20+** for host-only development.
- **Terraform 1.6+** and the **AWS CLI v2** when you touch AWS resources.
- An **AWS account** with credentials (`AWS_PROFILE` or standard access keys) when running Terraform or deploy workflows locally.

Secrets stay out of git. Copy `.env.example` at the **repository root** to `.env` and fill in values for your machine. Deployed environments should load the same keys from your secret manager or GitHub Actions secrets/variables.

## First-time local setup (without Docker)

```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh   # first clone only
cp .env.example .env    # optional but recommended
./scripts/bootstrap-local.sh
```

Start each service in its own terminal:

```bash
cd backend
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` for the UI and `http://localhost:8000/docs` for OpenAPI. The home page calls `/api/v1/health` so you can confirm both halves are talking.

### Environment variables (repo root `.env`)

Both FastAPI (`pydantic-settings`) and Next.js (via `dotenv-cli` in `frontend/package.json` scripts) read from the **same** `.env` at the repository root. Keep per-environment values out of source code—set them here locally, or inject them in CI/CD.

| Key | Consumers | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `API_HOST` | API | Bind address inside the container or host. |
| `API_PORT` | API | Port for Uvicorn when you run it manually. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | API | Comma-separated browser origins allowed to call the API. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | UI (build + browser) | Public API base URL the browser calls. Leave empty for production builds that should call same-origin `/api/*` through CloudFront. |
| `DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT` | API (`/api/v1/health` metadata) | Optional label such as `local`, `dev`, `staging`, or `prod`. |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | API | OpenRouter key; used for chat when set (with `LLM_BASE_URL` for OpenRouter). |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | API | Used for chat when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is unset; optional when OpenRouter is set. |
| `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` / `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` | API | Optional. [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) project keys for LLM tracing; set with `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` (or `LANGFUSE_HOST`) for EU/US/self-hosted. |

## Run the full stack in Docker

```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh   # first clone only
cp .env.example .env      # optional; run.sh exports it for Compose variable substitution
./scripts/run.sh
```

- API on `http://localhost:8000`
- UI on `http://localhost:3000` (**`next dev`** inside Compose — hot reload, not a production `next build`)
- **Why the first run can feel slow:** `./scripts/run.sh` runs `docker compose up --build`. The backend image pulls base layers and runs `uv sync` once; the frontend image runs **`npm ci`** during **`docker compose build`**. After that, Compose just starts the container; the UI is **`next dev`** from `frontend/Dockerfile`. To pick up new frontend dependencies after you edit **`package-lock.json`**, run `docker compose build frontend` (or `docker compose up --build`) again.

Stop everything with `./scripts/stop.sh`.

## Terraform (single root under `terraform/`)

`main.tf` holds the `terraform {}` block (including the empty **S3** `backend "s3" {}` stub), a `locals` name helper, and a **numbered checklist** for the architecture you are building toward. There are **no `resource` blocks** in this repository on purpose.

`variables.tf` / `outputs.tf` / `providers.tf` give you tagging defaults and a couple of outputs (`stack_name`, `aws_region`, `next_steps`) so CI and humans can sanity-check wiring before anyone adds modules or resources.

Nothing in the FastAPI or Next.js code hardcodes `dev`/`staging`/`prod`. Terraform’s `environment` variable is validated to those three values for tags and future state keys.

### Remote state

The `terraform {}` block declares an **S3 backend** (empty configuration). Every `terraform init` needs either:

- `terraform/backend.hcl` (copy `terraform/backend.hcl.example`), or
- `TALENTSTREAM_USE_LOCAL_TF_STATE=1` with `./scripts/deploy-aws.sh` for disposable local state (not for teams).

### Plan / destroy helpers

```bash
cd terraform
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# set aws_region, project_name, environment (dev | staging | prod)
```

From the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-aws.sh            # writes a plan (no apply)
./scripts/deploy-aws.sh staging
TF_ENVIRONMENT=prod ./scripts/deploy-aws.sh
```

`./scripts/destroy-aws.sh` is a thin wrapper around `terraform destroy` for when resources eventually exist.

**AWS deployment (Terraform, CLI, GitHub Actions)** is documented in the **[root `README.md`](../README.md)** (one level up from this folder).

## GitHub Actions (scaffold)

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pushes and pull requests to `main` but **only checks out the repository** and echoes that real CI is still to be defined (backend uv/tests, frontend npm/lint/build, Terraform fmt/validate, and so on).

`.github/workflows/deploy-aws.yml` is **manual (`workflow_dispatch`) only** and does **not** call AWS or Terraform. It prints a short checklist for when you add OIDC, secrets, `terraform apply`, image pushes, and static asset publishing.

For OIDC trust policy shaping, see `.github/aws/github-oidc-trust-policy.json.example` and replace `ACCOUNT_ID`, `GITHUB_ORG`, and `REPO` before attaching it to an IAM role.

**Current deploy automation** (if present in the repo) is described in the **[root deployment guide](../README.md)**.

## Where feature work should land

- **FastAPI routers**: add packages under `backend/app/api/v1/` (or new version folders) and include them from `backend/app/api/router.py`.
- **Agents / LangGraph**: keep graphs, tools, and state machines under `backend/app/services/langgraph/` so onboarding stays predictable.
- **UI routes and data fetching**: colocate routes in `frontend/src/app` (static export friendly) and keep shared helpers in `frontend/src/lib`.
- **Infrastructure growth**: add child modules under `terraform/modules/` (or keep everything flat) and call them from `terraform/main.tf` once you outgrow the four-file scaffold.

## Quality gates (lightweight for now)

```bash
cd frontend && npm run lint && npm run build
```

```bash
cd backend && uv sync && uv run python -m compileall -q app
```

Add pytest, Ruff, or mypy when the API surface grows; the scaffold stays intentionally small.

## Troubleshooting quick hits

- **UI shows “Backend not responding.”** Confirm Uvicorn is listening on `8000`, `CORS_ORIGINS` includes your UI origin, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` matches how your browser reaches the API.
- **`docker compose` cannot reach Docker.** Start Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) or the Linux daemon, then rerun `./scripts/run.sh`.
- **`http://localhost:3000` does nothing.** Confirm the frontend container is up (`docker compose ps`) and check `docker compose logs frontend`. If **`docker compose build frontend`** fails or the container exits with **137**, raise **Memory** in Docker Desktop (Settings → Resources), then rebuild. After **`package-lock.json`** changes, run `docker compose build frontend` (or `./scripts/run.sh` with `--build`) again.
- **Terraform init asks for backend settings.** Create `terraform/backend.hcl` or export `TALENTSTREAM_USE_LOCAL_TF_STATE=1` for disposable local state.
- **GitHub Actions.** The bundled workflows are placeholders only; there is nothing to “fix” for credentials until you replace them with real jobs.

For **deployment steps** (AWS, Terraform, GitHub), see the **[root `README.md`](../README.md)**.
